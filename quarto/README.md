## Functional Specs

- Quarto is a two-player game
- Quarto is played on a four-by-four board with 16 pieces shared by both players
- Each piece has four characteristics:
        - height (Tall or Short)
        - color  (Dark or Light)
        - top    (Flat-top or Hollow)
        - shape  (Square or Round)
- A player wins by matching pieces with any four characteristics
- Players should be prompted to pick a piece for their opponent to play
- Players can place their piece on any empty square



## MVP

### STARTING
- The four-by-four board starts off empty

### MOVING
- Player Two chooses a piece for Player One to play
- Player One then chooses a piece for Player Two to play

### WIN/ LOSE/ DRAW
- A player wins when they match any four pieces in a line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
- A draw results when all 16 pieces have placed on the board and no player has matched four traits in a line


##Why Quarto?

- I discovered Quarto while working for the now non-existent game store Marbles: The Brain Store.
- Combining the fun of Connect Four and the strategy of Chess, it quickly became one of my favorite games not only to recommend and sell, but to play.
